<h2>Reputable and extensible indicators</h2>

**Stock Indicators API** is a self-hosted REST API that converts financial market price quotes into trade indicators.  It's a language agnostic HTTP interface to our [popular NuGet library](https://dotnet.stockindicators.dev).  Both the library and this API are built with the latest .NET technology.  It can be hosted in almost any environment and operating system (Linux, Windows, MacOS, etc.).
